# Global Population and Economic Trends: 2000 - 2050â€“ Gapminder Analysis -  Gapminder Analysis


## Overview

This project analyzes World Development Statistics from Gapminder to explore trends in population, life expectancy, and income. The analysis utilizes Python, Pandas, and data visualization libraries to clean, explore, and visualize the datasets.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement guiding this analysis is: **To investigate the relationships and trends between population growth, life expectancy, and income across different countries over time, and to identify key factors influencing these trends.**

## Background

This project uses World Development Statistics from Gapminder, an organization dedicated to making global data accessible. The datasets provide insights into population, life expectancy, and annual Income pre Capita. The objective here is to find correlations, impacts on certain data point weither it is internal or external(short or long term).

## Data

The following datasets were used:

-   `population.csv`: Population by Country
-   `life_expectancy.csv`: Life Expectancy by Country
-   `daily_incom_per_capita.csv`: Daily Income Per Capita(Converted to Annual Income Per Capita)


## Conclusion

# Key Takeaways
**High Standard Deviation Values!!!** *Dataframes like **df_income** and **df_population** have high std values due to high variability i/e big value differences.
For exmaple population difference between China and Andorra or income difference between industriolized and developing countries.*

**Low Standard Deviation Values!!!** *Life expectancy in **df_life** ranges from 30 to 90 years, leading to a smaller standard deviation (4-7). This means most countries deviate only slightly from the average. A gradual increase in std suggests growing regional differences in life expectancy improvements..*

**Happy To Find** *For majority of developing world countries experienced significant growth in life expectancy as the result economic prosperity. 60%-70% developing countries moved to same cluster as industrialized countries in just last 50 years*

**Not So Happy To Find** *The data shows that Ireland's population saw the steepest decline over the past century.*

# Plots interpretation
 **1. Annual income VS Life Expectancy - Scatter Plot/Positive Correlation**   
 **2. Population Growth China, US and India 2000-2050 - Line Chart**   
 **3. Life Expectancy Distribution Per Country - Histogram**   


## Outside Research

Huge thanks to the previous Gapminder Data Science project authors, Nikhil and Lippins, for the inspiration and their creative approach to structuring this portfolio.

Utilized ChatGpt for assistance during pattern finding, found it especially helpful explaining in simple language why certain syntax written this way etc. My favorite prompt is "**explain me xyz as to bartender**" as this way it resonates better with my thought process as I am passionated in cocktail making.

## Challenges along the way and improvements

The main challenge was losing 7-8 hours worth EDA and visualization and having to do this again simply for not duplicating .ipynb file. Going forward more emphasize will be put on building problem tree before even jumping in to data exploration. This is my first explpratory analytics project on pandas.
